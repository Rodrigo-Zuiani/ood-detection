# Overview

This repository includes:
- Training of a ResNet-18 classifier on CIFAR-100
- Evaluation of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection methods
- Neural Collapse analysis

The project is organized across two Git branches:

## OOD

This branch contains the code for the first two bullet points in the overview section. The only OOD decection method which is not included in this branch in NECO, which is implemented later in the NeuralCollapse branch.

## NeuralCollapse

This branch contains the code for the last bullet point in the overview section and the NECO OOD decection method.
